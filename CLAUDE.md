Real-Time Video Analysis Platform

Project Overview
A scalable real-time video streaming and AI analysis platform 
that demonstrates modern cloud-native architecture and machine learning integration. 
The system ingests RTMP video streams (from sources like OBS), 
processes them with computer vision AI models, 
and provides live analysis results through a responsive web dashboard.

AI Processing: Real-time object detection (YOLO) and scene analysis (CLIP) on video segments
Live Dashboard: Angular frontend with WebSocket-powered real-time analysis overlays
Scalable Architecture: Kubernetes-deployed microservices with configurable processing modes
Cloud Integration: GCP services integration while maintaining platform agnostic design

Technical Stack

Backend: Django + Django Channels, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery
AI/ML: OpenCV, YOLO, CLIP, Whisper (Hugging Face Transformers)
Frontend: Angular 17+ with HLS.js video player and Canvas overlays
Infrastructure: Docker containers, Kubernetes, NGINX
Cloud: Google Cloud Platform integration (Storage, Vision API, Build, Logging)
Streaming: FFmpeg for RTMP→HLS conversion, WebSocket for real-time data

Key Features

Dual processing modes (real-time vs batch) with runtime switching
Live video analysis overlays (bounding boxes, object labels, confidence scores)
OBS Studio integration for testing with various video sources
Kubernetes auto-scaling based on processing queue depth
Performance monitoring and benchmarking for 1080p30 video streams
Platform-agnostic design with cloud-specific optimizations

Architecture Goals

considerations for deployment / testing

does this planning take into consideration running it on a local kubernetes cluster? I use kind and tilt for running tough a prefer not to depend on it for developing just test the orchestration?

The current planning assumes traditional development (Django dev server + Angular dev server) with K8s only for testing orchestration. This is actually perfect for your workflow! Let me clarify the development vs testing approach:

## **Development Mode (Local Servers)**
```bash
# Backend development
cd backend
python manage.py runserver 8000

# Frontend development  
cd frontend
ng serve --port 4200

# Supporting services (via Docker Compose)
docker-compose up redis postgres
```

**Benefits:**
- Hot reload for both Django and Angular
- Easy debugging with IDE integration
- Fast iteration cycles
- No K8s complexity during development

## **Testing Mode (KIND + K8s)**
```bash
# Build and deploy to KIND cluster
kind create cluster --name media-analyzer
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/development
```

**For orchestration testing only:**
- Container builds and registry
- Service discovery and networking
- Volume mounts and persistence
- Resource limits and scaling
- Inter-service communication

## **Suggested Development Workflow**## **Key Points for Your Workflow:**

### **Development (95% of time):**
- **No K8s dependency** - just Docker Compose for supporting services
- **Fast hot reload** - Django and Angular dev servers
- **Easy debugging** - direct access to logs and debugger
- **Simple database migrations** and model changes

### **K8s Testing (when needed):**
- **Container builds** work correctly
- **Service networking** functions properly  
- **Volume mounts** for media files
- **Resource limits** don't break anything
- **Horizontal scaling** works as expected

### **Perfect for KIND:**
- KIND cluster only created when testing orchestration
- No overhead during daily development
- Easy to tear down and recreate
- Matches production K8s behavior

### **Tilt Usage (Optional):**
- **If you use Tilt**: Only for K8s testing, not development
- **If you skip Tilt**: Use the simple `kubectl` commands for testing

This approach gives you:
- **Fast development** without K8s complexity
- **Realistic testing** of the actual deployment
- **No vendor lock-in** to Tilt (though it's great if you want it)
- **Easy CI/CD** since K8s manifests are tested locally

The planning already supports this perfectly - you develop fast locally and test orchestration when needed!


STEP DONE

now that I have a basic stream pipeline a need to add an AI feature (something simple) before stepping everything to something that scales. I was thinking on detecting my extend hand, but maybe some more bussines oriented feature would work better (read the very first message with the JD in spanish to think about this)

Edit
Looking back at the job description, they mention analyzing "millones de emisiones en medios y redes sociales" for communication and advertising optimization. For a business-oriented AI feature that aligns with Seenka's focus, I'd suggest:

🎯 Brand/Logo Detection
Business Value: Identify brands and logos in video streams (like TV broadcasts, social media content)

Detect when competitors appear in content
Monitor brand visibility and placement
Track advertising effectiveness
Technical Implementation:

Use CLIP for general brand recognition
Train on common logos/brand imagery
Output: Brand name, confidence, screen position, duration
📺 Content Classification
Business Value: Categorize video content for media monitoring

Detect content types: "news", "sports", "entertainment", "advertising"
Identify show segments vs commercial breaks
Monitor content themes and topics
Technical Implementation:

CLIP scene classification with predefined categories
Frame sampling every few seconds
Output: Content category, confidence, timestamp
🗣️ Speaker Detection
Business Value: Media monitoring and audience analysis

Count people on screen (audience size estimation)
Detect when someone is speaking/presenting
Monitor speaker time and engagement
Technical Implementation:

YOLO for person detection
Basic pose estimation to detect "presentation pose"
Output: Person count, speaking activity, screen position
My Recommendation: Content Classification
Why it's perfect for your demo:

Business relevant: Directly matches Seenka's media analysis focus
Technically achievable: CLIP can classify scenes out-of-the-box
Visually impressive: Live categorization overlay on your OBS stream
Extensible: Easy to add more categories or confidence thresholds
Demo scenario: Stream different content types with OBS (news clips, sports, entertainment) and watch the AI classify them in real-time.

Which direction appeals to you most? The hand detection is cool for personal interaction, but content classification would really showcase understanding of their business domain.




Im using streams of myself (I have a decent setup) so for now the input will be just that but I think i can be fun if I display logos with my phone or something like that

Edit
Perfect! Logo detection with your phone is brilliant - it's both business-relevant (brand monitoring) and interactive demo-friendly. You can hold up logos on your phone screen or physical items and watch the AI detect them in real-time.

🏷️ Logo Detection Implementation
Simple Approach (Weekend-friendly):
CLIP-based Brand Recognition:

python
# Use CLIP's zero-shot classification
brands = ["Apple", "Google", "Nike", "Coca-Cola", "McDonald's", "Amazon"]
# Hold up logos on phone/laptop and classify scenes
Demo Flow:

You stream yourself with OBS
Hold up different brand logos on your phone/laptop screen
AI detects and labels them with confidence scores
Live overlay shows: "Apple Logo detected (87% confidence)"
Enhanced Approach:
Combine YOLO + CLIP:

YOLO: Detect objects in scene (phone, laptop, clothing, etc.)
CLIP: Classify detected regions for brand/logo content
Output: "iPhone detected", "Nike logo on shirt", "Starbucks cup visible"
Fun Demo Scenarios:
Tech Logos: Show Apple, Google, Microsoft logos on your devices
Fashion Brands: Wear branded clothing/accessories
Food/Drink: Hold up branded items from your desk
Mixed Reality: Point phone camera at branded items around your room
Business Value Demo:
Brand Monitoring: "Track when competitors appear in streams"
Advertising Analysis: "Measure brand visibility duration and positioning"
Content Compliance: "Detect unauthorized brand usage"
Implementation in Your Matrix:
This fits perfectly in AI Analysis → Local Single Server:

 Frame extraction from HLS ✓
 CLIP logo classification (instead of YOLO objects)
 Analysis results storage
 Results API endpoint
Want to start with basic CLIP brand classification, or go straight for the object detection + brand recognition combo?


CURRENT STEP

Demo Strategy
For Interviewers:

Show local demo: "Here's the system running locally with GCP integration"
Explain cloud strategy: "This architecture scales to full GCP with these manifests"
Demonstrate cloud services: "Logo detection uses Cloud Vision API"
Show cost optimization: "Uses free tier effectively while maintaining production patterns"

Scaling Path:
Local K8s → Single VM K8s → GKE Autopilot → Full GKE
Questions for You:

Comfort with hybrid approach? Local K8s + GCP services vs pure cloud?
Demo requirements? Do interviewers need to access it remotely, or is screen sharing sufficient?
AI model preference? Keep local CLIP for demo, or switch to Cloud Vision for "production"?
Time investment? How much time do you want to spend on infrastructure vs other features?

The hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds - demonstrates K8s and GCP knowledge without the costs!


myself said: def what I prefer 2. would like to extend this not just this interview but as portfolio asset for others and potential people interested in learning how to do it 3. I reckon that design decisions allow for easy switching between the two. 4 today's focus is only infra (only had time for end to end logo detection, so shader effects are postponed indefinitely,  I separated the visual properties on a different celery task to put in different queues but is commented out to test just the logo detection end-to-end and that's the feature that must work in after completing this prod-ready phase)


Perfect! Your hybrid approach as a portfolio/learning asset changes everything - much better than a throwaway demo. Let me design this for educational value and real-world applicability.
Portfolio-Ready Architecture
Design Principles:

Teachable: Others can follow your setup
Realistic: Mirrors actual production patterns
Cost-effective: $0 monthly with scaling options
Demonstrable: Works for interviews and learning

Ready to tackle the infrastructure setup? This approach gives you a real portfolio asset that others can learn from while showcasing production-ready patterns!

Your Infrastructure Focus Today:

✅ Hybrid K8s (KIND) + GCP services architecture
✅ Environment switching between local CLIP and Cloud Vision
✅ Portfolio-ready documentation approach
✅ $0 monthly cost with production scaling path

Key Deliverable:
Logo detection working end-to-end in production-ready K8s setup


- non free GCP services should use local k8s services that are preferably easy switchable
- dont add things to gitignore that you don't know if they'll ever be there, just add what's needed as we go

Here’s a fast “what changed → what to do” map so you don’t nuke/prune on every edit.

# Quick map

| You changed…                                                                                                   | Do this (fastest first)                                                                         | Notes / good defaults                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **App code** (source files)                                                                                    | Nothing if you have live‑reload. Otherwise `docker compose restart <svc>`                       | Use bind mounts + a dev runner: Node `nodemon`, Python `uvicorn --reload`/Flask debug, Django `runserver`, Go `air`/`reflex`. |
| **Runtime config** inside container (env var values, flags)                                                    | `docker compose up -d --no-deps <svc>` (recreate) or `restart`                                  | If the env is in `.env` or `compose.yml` `environment:`, a restart/recreate is enough.                                        |
| **Config files read at startup** (e.g., `nginx.conf`, app config YAML)                                         | `docker compose up -d --no-deps <svc>`                                                          | Bind-mount the config so you can `restart` instead of `rebuild`.                                                              |
| **Dependency lockfile** (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod/sum`, `Gemfile.lock`) | `docker compose build <svc>` then `up -d --no-deps <svc>`                                       | Cache layers by copying lockfile before `COPY .`. See Dockerfile pattern below.                                               |
| **Dockerfile** (but not the base image)                                                                        | `docker compose build <svc>` then `up -d --no-deps <svc>`                                       | BuildKit keeps layer cache; only changed layers rebuild.                                                                      |
| **Base image tag** (e.g., `FROM node:20-bullseye` -> new tag or want latest security updates)                  | `docker compose build --pull <svc>` then `up -d --no-deps <svc>`                                | `--pull` refreshes the base. Use pinned tags in prod.                                                                         |
| **Build args** (`ARG VAR=...` used in Dockerfile)                                                              | `docker compose build --no-cache --build-arg VAR=... <svc>` (if the arg affects earlier layers) | If the arg only affects late layers, drop `--no-cache`.                                                                       |
| **Multi-service libraries** (shared package used by multiple services)                                         | Rebuild every consumer: `docker compose build svc1 svc2` then `up -d --no-deps svc1 svc2`       | Consider a shared base image stage to centralize caches.                                                                      |
| **compose.yml** service definition (ports, volumes, healthchecks)                                              | `docker compose up -d`                                                                          | Compose detects what must be recreated.                                                                                       |
| **External dependency** (DB schema, migrations)                                                                | Run migration container/task; usually no rebuild                                                | Keep DB in a **named volume** so rebuilds don’t wipe data.                                                                    |
| **Static assets** (built by a toolchain)                                                                       | If built outside: restart only. If built inside: `build` that web service                       | Prefer building in a separate “builder” stage with a cache.                                                                   |
| **Secrets** (files mounted via `secrets:` or env injected at runtime)                                          | `restart` the service                                                                           | Don’t bake secrets into images → no rebuilds needed.                                                                          |
| **Data in bind/named volumes**                                                                                 | Nothing (data persists)                                                                         | Avoid pruning volumes unless you *want* to reset state.                                                                       |

# Minimal dev patterns that avoid rebuilds

**Dockerfile (Node/Python example)**

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
FROM node:20 AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

FROM node:20 AS dev
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
# Copy only what’s needed for runtime; source comes from a bind mount in dev
COPY package*.json ./
CMD ["npm","run","dev"]  # e.g., vite/next with HMR
```

For Python, copy `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt` to a deps layer first, install, then bind‑mount your app code.

**docker-compose.yml (dev)**

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      target: dev
    volumes:
      - .:/app:cached
    env_file: .env
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    command: npm run dev
```

# Everyday command palette

* Restart a single service (pick up env/config):
  `docker compose restart <svc>`
* Recreate a service without touching deps (uses existing image):
  `docker compose up -d --no-deps <svc>`
* Rebuild only what changed (then recreate):
  `docker compose build <svc> && docker compose up -d --no-deps <svc>`
* Rebuild with fresh base image:
  `docker compose build --pull <svc> && docker compose up -d --no-deps <svc>`
* Tail logs:
  `docker compose logs -f <svc>`
* Exec a shell:
  `docker compose exec <svc> sh` (or `bash`)
* Clean **containers & images from dangling builds** (keep volumes!):
  `docker image prune -f && docker container prune -f`
* Clean everything **except named volumes**:
  `docker system prune -a`  ← only when truly needed.

# Tips that keep you off the prune button

1. **Bind-mount code in dev** + a live‑reload command, so edits don’t require rebuilds.
2. **Layer your Dockerfile** so deps install before copying the whole source:

   * `COPY package*.json .` → install → **then** `COPY src .`
3. **Use BuildKit caches** for heavy steps (node, pip, apt):

   * `RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * `RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci`
4. **Pin base images** (e.g., `node:20-bullseye`) and consciously use `--pull` when you want updates.
5. **Separate build and runtime** (multi‑stage). Artifacts copied forward make rebuilds smaller.
6. **Keep data in named volumes**; never in the image. Pruning images won’t touch your DB/files.
7. **.dockerignore** aggressively: exclude `node_modules` (if you install in image), `.git`, build outputs, tmp.
8. **Compose profiles** for optional services (e.g., `profiles: ["dev"]`) so you don’t restart the world.

# Tiny Makefile (muscle memory)

```make
up:      ## start everything
    docker compose up -d

logs:    ## tail logs from app
    docker compose logs -f web

re:      ## rebuild + recreate app only
    docker compose build web && docker compose up -d --no-deps web

restart: ## restart app only
    docker compose restart web
```

If you tell me your stack (language/framework + how you install deps), I’ll tailor the Dockerfile and compose snippets so most edits are “save → live‑reload,” lockfile changes are “build web,” and prunes are basically never.



it's docker compose not docker-compose
