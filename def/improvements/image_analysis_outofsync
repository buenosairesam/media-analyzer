> there is some delay on the image shown and the detection, like when I put the logo in from of the camera the detection shows before the image. dont correct that now 
  but for to know

‚óè Good observation! That's a classic real-time streaming issue where the analysis pipeline is running ahead of the video display pipeline.

  What's happening:
  - Analysis pipeline: Celery processes video segments immediately when they're created
  - Display pipeline: HLS player has buffering/latency for smooth playback
  - Result: AI detections appear before the video shows that frame

  Common causes:
  - HLS inherent latency (2-6 seconds typical)
  - Browser video buffering
  - Network buffering in HLS.js

  Potential solutions (for later):
  - Sync detections with video timestamp
  - Delay analysis results to match video latency
  - Use lower-latency streaming (WebRTC instead of HLS)
  - Add timestamp correlation between segments and detections

  For now, at least we know the AI pipeline is working fast! The detection accuracy and real-time processing are the main goals achieved. The timing sync is a polish
  issue we can address later. üì°‚è∞
