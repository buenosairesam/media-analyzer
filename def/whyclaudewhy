	why MEDIA_ROOT just in debug

	this to store media files which is obvious not ideal to store in the db (at least on postgres)


nginx
	why add cors straigth in nginx conf


	> is it correct to have cors configuration in nginx?

	● Yes and No - it depends on the service responsibility:

	  NGINX CORS is correct when:
	  - NGINX serves static media files (HLS videos)
	  - Browser needs to access video files cross-origin
	  - NGINX is the media server

	  Django CORS is correct when:
	  - Django serves API endpoints
	  - Angular makes API calls cross-origin
	  - Django is the application server

	  Your current setup needs BOTH:
	  - Django CORS: For Angular → Django API calls (/api/streams/)
	  - NGINX CORS: For Angular → NGINX media requests (/playlist.m3u8, /segment.ts)

	  Separation of concerns:
	  Angular (4200) → Django (8000)     # API calls - Django CORS
	  Angular (4200) → NGINX (8081)      # Video files - NGINX CORS

	  In production/K8s, you'd typically:
	  - Have one ingress controller handle all CORS
	  - Or use service mesh (Istio) for cross-origin policies

	  But for development, having CORS in both services is correct because they serve different content types to the browser.
