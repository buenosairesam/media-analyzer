> generate a diagram of the architecture to include in readme, just the diagram output in /def. ask question if needed, suggest options which technology to use to generate them I need a graphviz like 
  diagram of how services connect and some of design decisions on the code, like adapter for sources, and strategy for execution (local, lan, cloud), how the   │
  │    queue is organized in different analysis task, media storage, that could be media_root server by nginx or some cloud storage

● I'll create an architecture diagram showing the service connections and design patterns. Let me ask a few questions to make it accurate:

  Questions:
  1. Current media storage: Are you currently using local nginx-served files or cloud storage?
  2. Queue organization: Do you have separate queues like logo_queue, visual_queue, etc., or task routing by queue names?
  3. GCP services: Which specific GCP services are you integrating (Cloud Vision, Cloud Storage, others)?

  Diagram tool options:
  1. Graphviz/DOT - Clean, professional, version-controllable
  2. PlantUML - Good for architectural diagrams, supports multiple output formats
  3. Mermaid - GitHub-friendly, can render directly in markdown
  4. Python + matplotlib/networkx - Programmatic, customizable

  My recommendation: Graphviz/DOT because it:
  - Creates clean, professional diagrams
  - Is text-based (version control friendly)
  - Excellent for showing service connections and data flow
  - Industry standard for technical architecture

  Should I proceed with Graphviz showing:
  - Service containers (Django, Celery workers, Redis, PostgreSQL, nginx)
  - Design patterns (Source Adapters, Execution Strategies)
  - Queue segregation by analysis type
  - Media storage options (local vs cloud)
  - WebSocket connections for real-time updates

  What's your preference for the tool and any specific details to include/exclude?

> even if not ready the idea is to include planed features, maybe use a different style or color to signal this, also maybe use something like svg so easily updetable for when they are done, 2. same thing 
  now is only logo detection, need default as base,3, GCS and Vision for now, extra.. about tool options can you give links for demos that are reprensetative  of each to check the general feel. But I think 
  graphviz is the de facto, for super flexible and programable, not at all the usual WYSIWYG generic look which I'd like to avoid

● Perfect! Here are representative demos to see the visual style:

  Tool Options with Demos:

  1. Graphviz/DOT - https://graphviz.org/gallery/
    - Clean, programmatic, no WYSIWYG look
    - Example: https://graphviz.org/Gallery/directed/cluster.html
  2. PlantUML - https://real-world-plantuml.com/
    - Architecture: https://plantuml.com/c4-plantuml
  3. Mermaid - https://mermaid.live/
    - Architecture: https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNptkk1PwzAMhv-K5QtIq6vCx9ZlqiAmEEKIwwSInBqaOG2mxqlWM9Gf6nO6hB3dN0_8vI8f2ccEJqFABKNQzFklUMsK3CrRkrOQF2h8Lk2nPXRt67DpeQHe90QKFNYzb8e4qFXt-Rc
  4. Python + networkx - https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/auto_examples/index.html

  Graphviz is definitely the best choice for your needs - professional, flexible, no generic look, SVG output, version-controllable.

  For the diagram, I'll include:

  ✅ Current (solid lines/colors):
  - Django API, Celery logo workers, Redis, PostgreSQL
  - Webcam/RTMP source adapters
  - Local execution strategy
  - GCS + Vision API integration

  🔄 Planned (dashed lines/lighter colors):
  - Additional analysis workers (visual, audio, text)
  - LAN/Cloud execution strategies
  - Advanced queue routing
  - GPU effects pipeline

  Media storage: I'll show both nginx-served local and GCS options with a switch.

  Should I create the Graphviz DOT file now? It'll generate a clean SVG that you can easily update as features are implemented.

> yes if you need to generate many files, use a folder inside /def

● I'll create the architecture diagram using Graphviz. Let me create a folder and generate the files:

● Bash(mkdir -p /home/mariano/wdir/snk/def/architecture)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Write(~/wdir/snk/def/architecture/system_architecture.dot)

  The diagram shows:
  ✅ Current implementation (green, solid lines) - Logo detection with CLIP/GCP Vision🔄 Planned features (yellow, dashed lines) - Additional analysis types, LAN/Cloud strategies📐 Design patterns - Source
  adapters, execution strategies, queue segregation

  Now you can update the README to reference def/architecture/architecture_diagram.svg for the architecture diagram!

> can we make it less wide without making square smallers, so it looks better in the main github 
  page, I think that the workers could be aligned verticaly to make a clearer separation with the 
  "core", media and frontend, also a bit more contrast in the colors, not much, especialy grouping 
  background  squares
